1) Explain Big O notation and how it helps in analyzing algorithms.

Ans) Big O notation is a mathematical notation used to describe the upper bound of an algorithm's time complexity, which represents the worst-case scenario. It helps in analyzing the performance of algorithms as the input size grows

	O(1): Constant time - The algorithm's performance is not affected by the size of the input.
	O(n): Linear time - The algorithm's performance grows linearly with the input size.
	O(log n): Logarithmic time - The algorithm's performance grows logarithmically with the input size.
	O(n log n): Linearithmic time - The algorithm's performance grows in proportion to n log n.
	O(n^2): Quadratic time - The algorithm's performance grows quadratically with the input size.


2) Describe the best, average, and worst-case scenarios for search operations.

Ans)    Best Case: The scenario where the algorithm performs the minimum number of operations.
	Average Case: The scenario where the algorithm performs an average number of operations based on all possible inputs.
	Worst Case: The scenario where the algorithm performs the maximum number of operations.

3) Compare the time complexity of linear and binary search algorithms.

Ans) Linear Search:
	Best Case: O(1) - When the target product is the first element.
	Average Case: O(n) - When the target product is somewhere in the middle.
	Worst Case: O(n) - When the target product is the last element or not present.
     Binary Search:
	Best Case: O(1) - When the target product is at the middle.
	Average Case: O(log n) - When the target product is somewhere in the array.
	Worst Case: O(log n) - When the target product is at one end or not present.

4) Discuss which algorithm is more suitable for your platform and why.

Ans) Binary search is more suitable for the e-commerce platform because it offers faster search times (O(log n)) compared to linear search (O(n)). However, binary search requires the product array to be sorted. If the products are frequently updated, the cost of sorting must be considered.
